# OutsystemsVeersaApp
App made using Outsystems during Veersa Technologies Internship

Download and install the latest version of Outsystems Service Studio (version 11 as of writing this). You will need a personal development environment from Outsystems. Then double click on the oap files to import them to the workspace. Publish Veersa Tech Timesheet and you can view it in the link you will get.
You will also need to create users, or at least an admin user to start from https://personal-<your environment's code>.outsystemscloud.com/Users/User_List.aspx
 and then use that login to create anything else.
